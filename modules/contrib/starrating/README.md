Star Rating is a simple module that provides star rating field and display
formatter using Drupal 8's Field Type API.

Unlike Fivestar module and other voting/rating module, it supports neither end
user voting nor nice AJAX interface. It is inteded for the rating only by the
author of the article (node). Of course, you may be able to do this with
Fivestar module and other voting/rating modules, but unlike most of them, it
does not require other modules such as voting API module. It's born to be simple
but good enough for those who want star rating only by authors.

For example, if you are creating a restaurant review web site and you want to
add three 5 star ratings (food, price and service) with different icon type for
each rating within a node, then this module would be the best match.
